	(- go back to towncenter: You go back to the town menu.)

[General Information]
- Coded & compiled with Visual Studio 2019 Community
- Most likely incompitable with mods accessing the same files and/or implementing simular options like "WorkshopManager".

[Known Issues]
- Message "You are discarding items. Are you sure?" when puting items into stash, even they are saved and loaded on next savegame-load. (WORKING ON FIX)

[Recommended Mods]
- Workshop Manager: adds this option as well as some more things with stashes & workshops.
- WorkshopStash: even its broken, its the base version of this mods, so give it some love.
